## Tidy data
Most "wild" data that you will encounter are organized incorrectly for work in R and, as you might expect, the tools used to transform data are a core part of the tidyverse. I will attempt to summarize the most important points below, but you should read [chapter 12 of the data science text](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) for a more thorough explanation.  

`Tidy` data in the sense of the tidyverse follows three conventions:   
(1) each variable has its own column  
(2) each observation has its own row  
(3) each value has its own cell  

This is summarized in the image below. The package used to tidy data is called **tidyr** and is a core part of the tidyverse.

## `pivot_longer()`  
Scientists frequently use spreadsheets that are organized to make data entry efficient. This is often referred to as **wide format**. Unfortunately, the wide format creates a problem because column names may actually represent values of a variable. The command `pivot_longer()` shifts data from wide to long format.   

Rules:  
+ `pivot_longer`(cols, names_to, values_to)
+ `cols` - Columns to pivot to longer format
+ `names_to` - Name of the new column; it will contain the column names of gathered columns as values
+ `values_to` - Name of the new column; it will contain the data stored in the values of gathered columns

## Example 1: column names are data
The following data show results from a drug trial with four treatments on six patients. The values represent resting heart rate.  
```{r}
#heartrate <- read_csv("data/heartrate.csv")
#heartrate
# loading the data
```

Want to try the `here` package(https://here.r-lib.org/index.html)? I have found that many new R users have difficulty managing directories and accessing files. The `here` package makes this a bit more intuitive.
```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
#here()
# it always puts you in the main directory
```

```{r}
#heartrate <- read_csv(here("lab8", "data2", "heartrate.csv"))

# you need reader here just makes sure that the data. note that everything is sensitive so if you were to search your directory and lab 8 was included DO NOT write it while using here
```

```{r}
#heartrate

# always load the data to view
```

Let's assess whether or not these data are tidy.  
(1) each variable has its own column?  
 - by looking at the data no the a b c d ar different drugs  
(2) each observation has its own row?  
- yes
(3) each value has its own cell?  
- yes
To fix this problem, we need to reshape the table to long format while keeping track of column names and values. We do this using `pivot_longer()`. Notice that the dimensions of the data frame change.  
```{r}
heartrate %>% 
  pivot_longer(-patient, # patient will ot be removed
               names_to="drug", # make a new column name to drug
               values_to = "heartrate" #values moved to anew column names 
               )
```

## Practice
1. Import the file `relig_income.csv` and store it as a new object `relig_income`.  


```{r}
relig_income <- read_csv("data/relig_income.csv")
relig_income
```

2. Why are these data untidy?  
- These values are not tidy because each variable did not have their own rows or example the income gained is listed as a row instead of a column

3. Use `pivot_longer()` to make the data tidy.  
```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, # religion will ot be removed
               names_to="income", # make a new column name to income
               values_to = "n_income_ob" #values moved to a new column name numer of observations for each
               )
```

## Example 2: some column names are data
Some (but not all) of the column names are data. We also have NA's.
```{r}
billboard <- readr::read_csv("data/billboard.csv")
billboard
```

Solution 1: specify a range of columns that you want to pivot.
```{r}
billboard2 <- 
  billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(wk1:wk76, # this is specifiying a range of columns
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank",
               values_drop_na = TRUE #this will drop the NA's and cut back anywhere the sng fel of he chart
               )
billboard2
```

Solution 2: OR, specify columns that you want to stay fixed.
```{r}
billboard3 <- 
  billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(artist, track, date.entered), #specific columns
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank",
               values_drop_na = TRUE
               )
billboard3
```

Solution 3: identify columns by a prefix, remove the prefix and all NA's.
```{r}
billboard %>% 
   pivot_longer(
   cols = starts_with("wk"),
   names_to = "week",
   names_prefix = "wk",
   values_to = "rank",
   values_drop_na = TRUE)
# alll these examples make data frame much biggger on one end but ow we  hae a simplified version 
```

## Practice  
1. Import `plant_data.csv` as a new object `plant_data`.  
```{r}
plant_data <- read_csv("data/plant_data.csv")
plant_data
```

2. Why are these data not tidy?  
- The days are not represented in the right frame they should also be a variable

3. Use `pivot_longer()` to make the data tidy. Focus the data only on genotype, day, and measurement.  
```{r}
plant_data2 <- 
  plant_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(genotype, water_sched_prog, greenhouse), #specific columns
               names_to = "day",
               values_to = "measurement",
               values_drop_na = TRUE
               )
plant_data2
```

** Check the Question Above**
## Example 3: more than one variable in a column name
In this case, there are two observations in each column name.
```{r}
qpcr_untidy <- read_csv("data/qpcr_untidy.csv")
qpcr_untidy
```

`names_sep` helps pull these apart, but we still have "exp" and "rep" to deal with.  
```{r}
qpcr_untidy %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    exp1_rep1:exp3_rep3,
    names_to= c("experiment", "replicate"),
    names_sep="_",
    values_to="mRNA_expression"
  )
```

## Example 4: more than one value or observation in a row
This is often caused by an entry error, but R will not be able to work with it unless the values are separated. This doesn't use `pivot_longer()` but is a common problem.  
```{r}
length_data <- readr::read_csv("data/length_data.csv")
length_data
```

```{r}
length_data %>% 
  transform(length = str_split(length, ";")) %>%
  unnest(length)
```
