## Seating & Set-up
1. Please make sure that you sit next to your group members for the rest of the quarter.
2. Please set-up your computer as normal.

## Warm-up
1. Please load the homerange data `Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv`
```{r}
#homerange <- read_csv("data/Tamburelloetal_HomeRangeDatabase.csv", na="-999")%>%clean_names()
```

2. Show the min, mean, and max log10.mass by taxonomic class in the dataset.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  group_by(class) %>% 
  summarize(min_log10.mass=min(log10_mass),
            max_log10.mass=max(log10_mass),
            mean_log10.mass=mean(log10_mass),
            median_log10.mass=median(log10_mass)
            )
```

3. Make a plot that best summarizes this output.
```{r}
homerange %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=class, y=log10_mass))+
  geom_boxplot()
```
