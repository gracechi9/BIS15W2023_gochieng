## Tidy data
Most "wild" data that you will encounter are organized incorrectly for work in R and, as you might expect, the tools used to transform data are a core part of the tidyverse. I will attempt to summarize the most important points below, but you should read [chapter 12 of the data science text](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) for a more thorough explanation.  

`Tidy` data in the sense of the tidyverse follows three conventions:   
(1) each variable has its own column  
(2) each observation has its own row  
(3) each value has its own cell  

This is summarized in the image below. The package used to tidy data is called **tidyr** and is a core part of the tidyverse.  
![*Tidy Data.*](tidy-1.png)

## 8.1
## Example 1: column names are data
The following data show results from a drug trial with four treatments on six patients. The values represent resting heart rate.  
```{r}
heartrate <- read_csv("data/heartrate.csv")
heartrate
```

Want to try the `here` package(https://here.r-lib.org/index.html)? I have found that many new R users have difficulty managing directories and accessing files. The `here` package makes this a bit more intuitive.
```{r}
getwd()
```

```{r}
here()
# it always puts you in the main directory
```

```{r}
heartrate <- read_csv(here("lab8", "data2", "heartrate.csv"))
# you need reader here just makes sure that the data. note that everything i sensitive so if you were to search your directory and lab 8 was included DO NOT write it while using here
```

```{r}
heartrate
```

Let's assess whether or not these data are tidy.  
(1) each variable has its own column?  
 - by looking at the data no the a b c d ar different drugs  
(2) each observation has its own row?  
- yes
(3) each value has its own cell?  
- yes
To fix this problem, we need to reshape the table to long format while keeping track of column names and values. We do this using `pivot_longer()`. Notice that the dimensions of the data frame change.  
```{r}
heartrate %>% 
  pivot_longer(-patient, # patient will ot be removed
               names_to="drug", # make a new column name to drug
               values_to = "heartrate" #values moved to anew column names 
               )
```

## Practice
1. Import the file `relig_income.csv` and store it as a new object `relig_income`.  


```{r}
relig_income <- read_csv("data/relig_income.csv")
relig_income
```

2. Why are these data untidy?  
- These values are not tidy because each variable did not have their own rows or example the income gained is listed as a row instead of a column

3. Use `pivot_longer()` to make the data tidy.  
```{r}
relig_income %>% 
  pivot_longer(-religion, # religion will ot be removed
               names_to="income", # make a new column name to income
               values_to = "n_income_ob" #values moved to a new column name numer of observations for each
               )
```

## Example 2: some column names are data
Some (but not all) of the column names are data. We also have NA's.
```{r}
billboard <- readr::read_csv("data/billboard.csv")
billboard
```

Solution 1: specify a range of columns that you want to pivot.
```{r}
billboard2 <- 
  billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(wk1:wk76, # this is specifiying a range of columns
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank",
               values_drop_na = TRUE #this will drop the NA's and cut back anywhere the sng fel of he chart
               )
billboard2
```

Solution 2: OR, specify columns that you want to stay fixed.
```{r}
billboard3 <- 
  billboard %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(artist, track, date.entered), #specific columns
               names_to = "week",
               values_to = "rank",
               values_drop_na = TRUE
               )
billboard3
```

Solution 3: identify columns by a prefix, remove the prefix and all NA's.
```{r}
billboard %>% 
   pivot_longer(
   cols = starts_with("wk"),
   names_to = "week",
   names_prefix = "wk",
   values_to = "rank",
   values_drop_na = TRUE)
# alll these examples make data frame much biggger on one end but ow we  hae a simplified version 
```

## Practice  
1. Import `plant_data.csv` as a new object `plant_data`.  
```{r}
plant_data <- read_csv("data/plant_data.csv")
plant_data
```

2. Why are these data not tidy?  
- The days are not represented in the right frame they should also be a variable

3. Use `pivot_longer()` to make the data tidy. Focus the data only on genotype, day, and measurement.  
```{r}
plant_data2 <- 
  plant_data %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(genotype, water_sched_prog, greenhouse), #specific columns
               names_to = "day",
               values_to = "measurement",
               values_drop_na = TRUE
               )
plant_data2
```

** Check the Question Above**
## Example 3: more than one variable in a column name
In this case, there are two observations in each column name.
```{r}
qpcr_untidy <- read_csv("data/qpcr_untidy.csv")
qpcr_untidy
```

`names_sep` helps pull these apart, but we still have "exp" and "rep" to deal with.  
```{r}
qpcr_untidy %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    exp1_rep1:exp3_rep3,
    names_to= c("experiment", "replicate"),
    names_sep="_",
    values_to="mRNA_expression"
  )
```

## Example 4: more than one value or observation in a row
This is often caused by an entry error, but R will not be able to work with it unless the values are separated. This doesn't use `pivot_longer()` but is a common problem.  
```{r}
length_data <- readr::read_csv("data/length_data.csv")
length_data
```

```{r}
length_data %>% 
  transform(length = str_split(length, ";")) %>%
  unnest(length)
```

## 8.2

## Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

## `pivot_longer()`
Recall that we use `pivot_longer()` when our column names actually represent variables. A classic example would be that the column names represent observations of a variable.
```{r}
datasets::USPersonalExpenditure
?USPersonalExpenditure
```

Here we add a new column of expenditure types, which are stored as rownames above, with `mutate()`. The `USPersonalExpenditures` data also needs to be converted to a data frame before we can use the tidyverse functions, because it comes as a matrix.
```{r}
expenditures <- 
  USPersonalExpenditure %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(expenditure = rownames(USPersonalExpenditure))
expenditures
```

## Practice
1. Are these data tidy? Please use `pivot_longer()` to tidy the data.
```{r}
expenditures %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(-expenditure), #specific columns
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "total_measure",
               values_drop_na = TRUE
               )
  
```

2. Restrict the data to medical and health expenditures only. Sort in ascending order.
```{r}
expenditures %>% 
  pivot_longer(c(-expenditure), #specific columns
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "bn_dollars") %>% 
  filter(expenditure=="Medical and Health") %>% 
  arrange(-bn_dollars)
```

## `separate()`
In this new heart rate example, we have the sex of each patient included with their name. Are these data tidy? No, there is more than one value per cell in the patient column and the columns a, b, c, d once again represent values.
```{r}
heartrate2 <- readr::read_csv("data/heartrate2.csv")
heartrate2 # first f all eww its not a tidy data we need a column for durgs and sex is an observation
```

We need to start by separating the patient names from their sexes. `separate()` needs to know which column you want to split, the names of the new columns, and what to look for in terms of breaks in the data.
```{r}
heartrate2 %>% 
  separate(patient, into= c("patient", "sex"), sep = "_")
```

## Practice
1. Re-examine `heartrate2`. Use `separate()` for the sexes, `pivot_longer()` to tidy, and `arrange()` to organize by patient and drug. Store this as a new object `heartrate3`.  
```{r}
heartrate3 <- heartrate2 %>% 
  separate(patient, into=c("patient", "sex"), sep="_") %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(patient, sex),
               names_to = "drug",
               values_to = "heartrate")
heartrate3
```


2. `unite()` is the opposite of separate(). Its syntax is straightforward. You only need to give a new column name and then list the columns to combine with a separation character.  Give it a try below by recombining patient and sex from `heartrate3`.  
```{r}
heartrate3 %>% 
  unite(patient_sex, "patient", "sex", sep=" ")
```


## `pivot_wider()`
The opposite of `pivot_longer()`. You use `pivot_wider()` when you have an observation scattered across multiple rows. In the example below, `cases` and `population` represent variable names not observations.  

Rules:  
+ `pivot_wider`(names_from, values_from)  
+ `names_from` - Values in the `names_from` column will become new column names  
+ `values_from` - Cell values will be taken from the `values_from` column  

```{r}
tb_data <- read_csv("data/tb_data.csv")
tb_data
```

When using `pivot_wider()` we use `names_from` to identify the variables (new column names) and `values_from` to identify the values associated with the new columns.
```{r}
tb_data %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "key", #the observations under key will become new columns
              values_from = "value")
```

## Practice
1. Load the `gene_exp.csv` data as a new object `gene_exp`. Are these data tidy? Use `pivot_wider()` to tidy the data.
```{r}
gene_exp <- read_csv("data/gene_exp.csv")
gene_exp
```

```{r}
gene_exp %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "type", #the observations under type will become new columns
              values_from = "L4_values")
```

## `pivot_wider()` with multiple variables  
What happens when we want to use `pivot_wider()` with multiple columns?
```{r}
edu_level <- readr::read_csv("data/education_level.csv")
edu_level
```

We want to pivot the `edu_level` data such that there is only a single row per demographic. 
```{r}
edu_level %>% 
pivot_wider(names_from = (education_level), #new column names come from the education_level column
                values_from = c(mean_income, n)) #values come from two separate columns
```

## Practice
For the last practice example, I will use data from the awesome [R Ladies Sydney](https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/02-cleanitup-5/) blog. This data set is compiled by the NSW Office of Environment and Heritage contains the enterococci counts in water samples obtained from Sydney beaches as part of the Beachwatch Water Quality Program! The data set we’ll be working with is current as of October 13th 2018.  

1. Load the beachbugs data and have a look.
```{r}
beachbugs <- readr::read_csv("data/beachbugs_long.csv")
beachbugs
```

2. Use `pivot_wider` to transform the data into wide format.
```{r}
beachbugs_wide<-beachbugs %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = "site", 
              values_from = "buglevels")
# created a new vaule known as beach bugs wide then we use the now knew value to pivot_longrr
```

3. Now, use `pivot_longer` to transform them back to long!

```{r}
beachbugs_wide%>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(year), #specific columns
               names_to = "beach",
               values_to = "total_bugs",
               )

```
